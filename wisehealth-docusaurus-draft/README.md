# WiseHealth Docusaurus Skeleton (DRAFT)

> **DRAFT**: This is an example skeleton for a WiseHealth website built with Docusaurus.
> It is meant to be adjusted, verified and copied into a real Docusaurus project
> created with `npx create-docusaurus@latest`. Do **not** treat this as final or fully correct.

## How to use

1. Create a new Docusaurus site (classic template) in a separate directory:

   ```bash
   npx create-docusaurus@latest wisehealth-website classic
   ```

2. Copy the contents of the `src/` folder from this draft into your new project's `src/` folder.
   - Merge instead of overwrite if needed.
3. Optionally compare `docusaurus.config.draft.ts` and `netlify.draft.toml` with your generated
   `docusaurus.config` and your Netlify settings.
4. Configure the environment variable `MYDR_BOOKING_URL` in Netlify to point to your MyDr booking page.
5. Review and edit all text (it's only a suggested draft) and fill in placeholder data (names, prices, address, etc.).
